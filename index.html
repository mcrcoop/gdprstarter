    <h2>7. How and when can you withdraw your consent?</h2>
    <p>Where we’re relying upon your consent to process personal data, you can withdraw this at any time by contacting us using our <a href="#contact">contact details</a> or website Contact section: <a href="https://#CONTACTURL#">https://#CONTACTURL#</a>.</p>

    <h2>8. Is your personal information transferred outside the #BASECOUNTRY#, #OFFERCOUNTRY# or the EEA?</h2>
    <p>We’re based in the #BASECOUNTRY# but sometimes your personal information may be transferred outside the European Economic Area. If we do so we’ll make sure that suitable safeguards are in place, for example by using approved contractual agreements, unless certain exceptions apply.</p>

    <h2>9. How do we share your information with credit reference agencies?</h2>
    <p>To process your requests, we’ll perform credit and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs). Where you use #FISCALFACILTIES# from us we may also make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your account with us. To do this we’ll supply your personal information to CRAs and they will give us information about you. This will include information from your credit application and about your financial situation and financial history. CRAs will supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit, financial situation and financial history information and fraud prevention information.</p>
    <p>We’ll use this information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product</li>
      <li>Verify the accuracy of the data you have provided to us</li>
      <li>Prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering</li>
      <li>Manage your account(s)</li>
      <li>Assess payment methods available to you</li>
      <li>Trace and recover debts</li>
      <li>Make sure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’ll continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We’ll also notify the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and don’t repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be given to other organisations by CRAs. The identities of the CRAs, their role as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail on our website.</p>
    <p>When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.</p>
    <p>If you’re making a joint application, or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we’ll link your records together, so you should make sure you discuss this with them, and share with them this information, before lodging the application. CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.</p>

We may also do this using data from other parts of the #GROUPNAME#, including product or services details (including usage of them or claims made) and data captured in the use of our services.</p>
    <p>We’ll do this where it is necessary for entering into or performing the relevant contract, is authorised by laws that apply to us, or is based on your explicit consent.</p>

    <h2 id="retained">15. For how long is your personal information retained by us?</h2>
